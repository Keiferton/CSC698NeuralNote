# NeuralNote Docs

Lightweight documentation to keep the MVP aligned and easy to extend.

- See `architecture.md` for a system overview and run expectations.
- See `api.md` for the REST surface and request/response shapes.
- See `data-models.md` for the Postgres schema and relationships.

Add new notes here as you iterate so the README can stay short.
